// bham or the "blocky hypertext abstraction markup"
// is an attempt to take what is good about languages
// like haml, jade, slim, etc. and port it to Go, but
// not blindly. It will take into account the capabilities
// of Go's template libraries to parse directly into the
// internal template structures that the stdlib template
// libraries use to provide both speed and interoperability
// with standard Go templates.
